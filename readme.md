# To-do:

-   [ ] Unify creation of time skip buttons, and maybe remove the ones from the settings page
-   [] Add fancy settings with default values for
    -   [] Max away time (default unlimited?)
    -   [] Away time multiplier (default 0.8?)
-   [] Make the skip buttons look a little prettier
-   [] _DREAM_ Maybe incorporate the time estimate mod to determine if the current time skip will result in wasted time? (ie: Time skipping cooking for 4hrs with only 69 raw shrimp)

# Done

-   [x] Global DD:HH:MM Display button should open a menu.
-   [x] Global Display button should update the remaining time after a skip occurs.
-   [x] Bug: Display was 20h 01m after first log in, then logging in immediately after that, the display was 00h 00m. Console states that it still remembers I have spendable ticks though.
-   [x] Report when ticks are successfully added when replacing offline time (maybe like item drops?)
