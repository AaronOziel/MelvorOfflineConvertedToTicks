#To-do:

-   Global DD:HH:MM Display button should open a menu.
-   Global Display button should update the remaining time after a skip occurs.
-   Bug: Display was 20h 01m after first log in, then logging in immediately after that, the display was 00h 00m. Console states that it still remembers I have spendable ticks though.
-   Report when ticks are successfully added when replacing offline time (maybe like item drops?)
