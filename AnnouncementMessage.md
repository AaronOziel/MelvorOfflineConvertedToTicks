Hey guys, I made a new mod called [**Offline Time Bank**](LINKHERE)! It's a mod that adds a feature I have dreamed about for almost a year now, Time Banking! While you are away you no longer get progress, instead when you log in all that time you would have gotten is instead put in a bank for you to use whenever you feel like it. You can spend the banked time to skip into the future and get offline progress in smaller chunks. Its actually very similar to the way ticks work for Township. If you hate ticks then you can safely ignore this mod. Come check out the advanced description on the mod's [mod.io Page](LINKHERE)! Now you can spend all that time you were away however you want, all your Offline Time is now Banked!
